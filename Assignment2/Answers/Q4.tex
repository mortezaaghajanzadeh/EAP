\section*{Question 4}
Here, I replicated all the results from the previous question by implementing three changes in the data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I create 10 portfolios based on the characteristic of the stocks.
    \item I exclude the stocks with a price lower than 5 dollars.
    \item I exclude the stocks with a market capitalization lower than 20 percentiles of the market capitalization each month.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item 
The cumulative return of long-short portfolio is shown in the figure \ref{fig:4c}. The pattern is quiet similar to the previous question. The cumulative return for equal weighted is higher that value weighted.

    \caption{Time series of the average returns of the long-short portfolio.}
    \label{fig:4c}
\end{figure}

Now you can see the $\alpha$ test for long-short portfolio with different models in the table \ref{tab:4c}. The results are in line with the previous question but the statistical significance is lower.

\item Here are the results for the $\alpha$ test for long-short portfolio for in and out of sample with equal weighting and market weighting in the tables \ref{tab:4d1} and \ref{tab:4d2} respectively.
